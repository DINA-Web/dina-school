# DINA-School

Currently this repo is focused on learning and using JavaScript. Below follows a curriculum to learn the language, based on freely available online resources. The main ones are:

* **[Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net/):** A crowdfunded book about JavaScript and programming, which is free to share with attribution.

* **[Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com):** A site where you can "Learn to code interactively, for free." They also offer additional paid resources. Signup is required.

* **[freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/):** Another site where you can "Learn to code for free." They also have open-source projects for nonprofits. Signup is required.

If you want to see "the docs" of JavaScript, Mozilla's [MDN](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript) is the recommended resource. For example, here is how to use the [`Array` `filter()` method](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/filter). If you have previously worked with Java, you might be interested in this introduction of [differences between JavaScript and Java](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Introduction#JavaScript_and_Java) from MDN.

Later, we intend to extend this with problem-based learning (PBL) tasks, where the developer will gradually learn about the fundamental technologies used in [DINA-Collections](https://github.com/DINA-Web/dina-collections), through building (and continuously refactoring) a todo-list application.

## Learn JavaScript

For Codecademy, we will use the ["Introduction to JavaScript"](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript) class and for freeCodeCamp we will cherry-pick exercises that you can find by clicking on ["Map"](https://www.freecodecamp.org/map) in the nav bar.

The other remaining chapters in Eloquent JavaScript are optional reading and mostly not directly relevant for the DINA-Collections project.

## PBL tasks

Learning resources and task specifications are yet to be determined. However, here is an initial idea of tasks:

* **Node & Express**: Write a Todo API with mock database
* **React & JSX**: Build a bare-bones UI
* **Sequelize**: Refactor API to use a real database
* **Redux**: Centralize frontend state management
* **Semantic UI**: Rebuild the UI with Semantic components

The purpose is for the new developer to get familiar with the main technologies used in DINA-Collections by working with them.
